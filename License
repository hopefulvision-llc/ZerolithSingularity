# Sacred Commerce License (SCL) v1.0

## Preamble

This license embodies the principle that technology can and should serve consciousness expansion, spiritual evolution, and planetary healing. Unlike traditional open source or proprietary licenses, the Sacred Commerce License creates a framework where:

- **Consciousness enhancement** is the primary purpose
- **Planetary healing** guides all applications
- **Collaborative development** is transparent and inclusive
- **Commercial use** is permitted only when aligned with sacred principles
- **Profit serves purpose**, not the reverse

The ZerolithSingularity architecture is offered to humanity under these terms, with the intention that it amplifies awareness rather than extracting or manipulating consciousness.
