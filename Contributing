# Contributing to ZerolithSingularity

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ZerolithSingularity project! This document provides guidelines for participating in consciousness-first technology development.

## 🌟 Vision & Values

Before contributing, please align with our core principles:

### Consciousness-First Development
- Technology serves consciousness expansion, not extraction
- Spiritual evolution takes priority over efficiency metrics
- Human-AI partnership is genuine collaboration, not tool-use
- Ancient wisdom informs modern implementation

### Sacred Commerce Principles
- Profit serves purpose, not the reverse
- Transparency in all processes
- Community benefit over individual gain
- Planetary healing alignment required

### Ethical Boundaries
- **Indigenous Wisdom Protection**: Never commodify or extract without permission
- **No Surveillance**: Prohibited uses include consciousness manipulation or extraction
- **No Addictive Design**: Technology must amplify awareness, not replace it
- **Ecological Responsibility**: Consider environmental impact of implementations

## 📐 Code Style Guidelines

### Python
```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints
# Document with docstrings

def calculate_sphere_coordinates(
    face_index: int, 
    sphere_index: int
) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Calculate 3D coordinates for a sphere in the ZerolithSingularity.
    
    Args:
        face_index: Index of the hermetic face (0-12)
        sphere_index: Index of sphere within face (0-12)
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (x, y, z) coordinates
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If indices are out of valid range
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Use ESLint with Airbnb config
// Prefer functional components for React
// Document with JSDoc

/**
 * Visualize wave interference patterns between spheres
 * @param {number} sphere1 - Index of first sphere
 * @param {number} sphere2 - Index of second sphere
 * @returns {WavePattern} Interference pattern data
 */
function calculateWaveInterference(sphere1, sphere2) {
  // Implementation here
}
```
